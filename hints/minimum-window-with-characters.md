    You should aim for a solution with <code>O(n)</code> time and <code>O(m)</code> space, where <code>n</code> is the length of the string <code>s</code> and <code>m</code> is the number of unique characters in <code>s</code> and <code>t</code>.

    A brute force solution would involve checking every substring of <code>s</code> against <code>t</code> and returning the minimum length valid substring. This would be an <code>O(n^2)</code> solution. Can you think of a better way? Maybe you should think in terms of frequency of characters.

    We need to find substrings in <code>s</code> that should have atleast the characters of <code>t</code>. We can use hash maps to maintain the frequencies of characters. It will be <code>O(1)</code> for lookups. Can you think of an algorithm now?

    We can use a dynamically sized sliding window approach on <code>s</code>. We iterate through <code>s</code> while maintaining a window. If the current window contains at least the frequency of characters from <code>t</code>, we update the result and shrink the window until it is valid.

    <p>
    We should ensure that we maintain the result substring and only update it if we find a shorter valid substring. Additionally, we need to keep track of the result substring's length so that we can return an empty string if no valid substring is found.
