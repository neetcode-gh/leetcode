    <summary>Recommended Time & Space Complexity</summary>
    <p>
    You should aim for a solution as good or better than <code>O(logn)</code> time and <code>O(logn)</code> space, where <code>n</code> is the given integer.

    <p>
    Create a helper function that returns the sum of the squares of a number's digits. Then, simulate the given process. If we reach <code>1</code>, return <code>true</code>. However, we may get stuck in a cycle if a number is processed more than once. What data structure can be used to detect if a number has already been processed?

    <p>
    We can use a hash set to detect if a number has already been processed. At each step, we update <code>n</code> with the return value of the helper function. If the result is <code>1</code>, we return <code>true</code>. If <code>n</code> is already in the set, we return <code>false</code>. Otherwise, we add <code>n</code> to the hash set and continue.
