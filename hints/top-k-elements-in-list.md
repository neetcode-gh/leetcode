    You should aim for a solution with <code>O(n)</code> time and <code>O(n)</code> space, where <code>n</code> is the size of the input array.

    A naive solution would be to count the frequency of each number and then sort the array based on each elementâ€™s frequency. After that, we would select the top <code>k</code> frequent elements. This would be an <code>O(nlogn)</code> solution. Though this solution is acceptable, can you think of a better way?

    Can you think of an algorithm which involves grouping numbers based on their frequency?

    <p>
    Use the bucket sort algorithm to create <code>n</code> buckets, grouping numbers based on their frequencies from <code>1</code> to <code>n</code>. Then, pick the top <code>k</code> numbers from the buckets, starting from <code>n</code> down to <code>1</code>.
