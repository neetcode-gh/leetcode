    You should aim for a solution with <code>O(n)</code> time and <code>O(n)</code> space, where <code>n</code> is the number of nodes in the given tree.

    A straightforward way to serialize a tree is by traversing it and adding nodes to a string separated by a delimiter (example: ","), but this does not handle <code>null</code> nodes effectively. During deserialization, it becomes unclear where to stop or how to handle missing children. Can you think of a way to indicate <code>null</code> nodes explicitly?

    <p>
    Including a placeholder for <code>null</code> nodes (example: "N") during serialization ensures that the exact structure of the tree is preserved. This placeholder allows us to identify missing children and reconstruct the tree accurately during deserialization.

    <p>
    We can use the Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm for both serialization and deserialization. During serialization, we traverse the tree and add node values to the result string separated by a delimiter, inserting <code>N</code> whenever we encounter a <code>null</code> node. During deserialization, we process the serialized string using an index <code>i</code>, create nodes for valid values, and return from the current path whenever we encounter <code>N</code>, reconstructing the tree accurately.
